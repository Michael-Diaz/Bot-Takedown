# Bot-Takedown
After viewing a script of similar design, I was inspired to recreate it given my free time during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, without access to iMessage, I decided to go about executing the script in a different manner. The result was python script that floods targetable spam accounts on Facebook messenger with a chosen text, one word at a time.


## Usage
This script can be run from the command line; was created using Python 3.6.8
Makes use of the following modules:

- sys
- fbchat
- getpass
- random
- time

Additionally, this script requires an active account on Facebook to properly utilize
(***Modifications to the code may result in some form of suspension of your Facebook account***)

# Acknowledgements
Inspiration was taken from TikTok user's @nehaxc script that wrote the Bee Movie one word at a time through iMessage
